The goal of __expstudy__ is to provide a set of tools to quickly conduct analysis of an experience study. Commonly used techniques (such as actual-to-expected analysis) are generalized and streamlined so that repetitive coding is avoided. 

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE} 
# This package has not yet been submitted to CRAN, however,
# you can install the development version from GitHub:

# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('cb12991/expstudy')
```

## Usage

```{r example}
library(expstudy)
```

First you need a dataset that can be used for an experience study. This package provides a sample mortality experience study to aid with examples:

```{r}
glimpse(mortexp)
```

Now you can convert to an `expstudy` object:

```{r}
# Only need to specify which variables correlate to metric variable `actuals`, 
# `expecteds`, and `exposures`. `variances` and `keys` are beneficial, but not
# required. 

es <- expstudy(
  data = mortexp,
  actuals = ACTUAL_DEATHS,
  expecteds = EXPECTED_DEATHS,
  exposures = EXPOSURE,
  variances = VARIANCE_DEATHS
)
```

With this `expstudy` object, a quick example can be shown using `compile_results()`:

```{r}
# We will supply only the dataset and grouping variables to use for the 
# summaries to generate a more robust list of results. 

results <- compile_results(
  expstudy = es,
  GENDER,
  ATTAINED_AGE
)
```

The `compile_results()` function combines many `expstudy` functions to produce many summaries. Since nothing other than the potential groupings were provided, `coompile_results()` will generate a nested list of summaries:

```{r}
glimpse(results, give.attr = FALSE)
```

An unformatted summary can be used for subsequent analysis...

```{r}
results$UNFORMATTED$METRICS$`BY GENDER`
```

...and a formatted summary can be quickly and simply inserted into a report to distribute nicely. 

```{r}
results$FORMATTED$PROPORTIONS$`BY ATTAINED_AGE`
```

You can review and trim the summaries down to what you want without much effort. You also can access the formulae that are used in `compile_results()` to fully customize the analysis to fit your needs.
