Description: Provides a data class of 'tbl_es' to help aid in the formation and
    analyses of recurrent or novel experience studies. A 'tbl_es' has attributes
    which identify the key variables used for calculating metrics under an 
    actuarial perspective. Common metrics (such as actual-to-expected analysis) 
    can be quickly generated in aggregate or according to different qualitative 
    factors. If multiple factors are of interest, grouped metrics can be 
    automatically computed for each factor individually as well as for all 
    possible combinations. All resulting output can then be formatted for 
    presentations or left unformatted for subsequent analyses. Ultimately, this
    package aims to reduce time spent completing repetitive code therefore 
    increasing time for analysis and insight.
